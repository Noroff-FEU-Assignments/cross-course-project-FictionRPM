    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my second website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">To start off, the customer should always use a strong password or a two-party authentication process. 

        I would suggest that the customer shield their website against SQL injections, they need to use a parameterized query, which is simple to implement as most web languages have it. Install a Security socket layer (ssl) to your website by using HTTPS. 
        
        The customer should use an advanced SDL, or security development lifecycle to protect against XSS or cross-site script attacks. 
        
        Always use an encrypted email port and don't allow file uploads. If you would however want to allow file uploads, I would suggest to store those files outside of your website folder and use something like SSH or SFTP to transport them, additionally you could store your database on a different server. 
        
        Finally, I would suggest that the customer invest website security scanners that will identify technical weaknesses in your website, including weaknesses that will be vulnerable to SQL Injection and XSS attacks among many others.</p>
